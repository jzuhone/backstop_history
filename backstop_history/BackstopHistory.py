         cut at the time of shutdown. 

         THe SCS 107 commands are inserted after the time of shutdown

         LTCTI is looked for in the NLET file and if it exists, it is inserted
         into the history

         There is a check for the  AOACRSTD command in the TOO load and it's
         placed accordingly via a sort.

         Steps:

             1) Trim all commands from the continuity load on and after the
                SCS-107 interrupt time.

             2) Add in the SCS-107 Shutdown commands (SIMTRANS, AA, AA, WSPOW)

             3) Check for any LTCTI's. If they exist, add them to the master list.

             4) Trim the beginning of the VO load to eliminate that part of the
                continuity load you are keeping.  

             5) Trim the back end of the VR file to the Review load start time

             6)  Concatenate the VO remnant to the assembled continuity.

             7) Concatenate the Review Load

         NOTE: By "review" load we mean the load being reviewed this week OR
               a combination of one or more continuity loads with the load
               being reviewed this week.  This routine can be called multiple
               times - tacking continuity loads to the start of the "master list"

                 Call this when you are reviewing a normal week-to-week load

        The only input is a list of paths to one or  more backstop files.

        Backstop files are found in the ACIS ofls directory and always start
        with the letters "CR" and end with the extension ".backstop"

          SCS clear and disable commands: 'CODISAS1', 'COCLRS1'

        More can be added later if required.
