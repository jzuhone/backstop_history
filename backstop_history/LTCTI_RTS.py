class LTCTI_RTS(object):
    """
    This class allows the user to convert a FOT, ACIS, LTCTI, RTS file, along with
    information found in a FOT Request, and generate a list of dicts where each line in the RTS file is
    processed and converted to a dict in the SKA.parse format. Each dict is appended
    to an output list.

    The format of the RTS file and the FOT request are described in OP-19.

    An example line from the LTCTI FOT request looks like this:

        RTSLOAD,1_CTI06,SCS_NUM=135,NUM_HOURS=001:15:00:00

    This line tells you that:

      1) You should use the 1_CTI06.RTS RTS file (this is a 6 chip LTCTI run)
      2) The commands will be placed in SCS slot 135
      3) The length of the CTI run - if undisturbed by a Return to Science - is
         1 day, 15 hours 0 minutes and 0 seconds.

    A Sample input line from the .RTS file looks like this:

         ACIS,WSPOW0CF3F,DELTA=00:00:01.000

    This line informs you that it's an ACIS command, that the command mnemonic is 
    WSPOW0CF3F, and (VERY important) that the command should be executed 1 second after the 
    previous command (or 1 second after the start time of the RTS execution for the first
    command in the RTS).

    The method processRTS() takes the start time and any DELTA parameter in the RTS line
    and calculates the execution time of the command. If no DELTA appears in the line
    being processed then the last computed time is used.


    You can process an actual FOT request, like the example above, or get the values from
    some other means, such as the Non-Load Event Tracking file.

    The conversion is a three step process:

    First, the FOT request file is read and information extracted using

        parse_FOT_request(fot_request).

    Among other things, this file tells you which CTI RTS  file should be used. You can 
    Yuo can skip this step and proceed directly to Step 2 if you have obtained the necessary
    information in some other way.

    Second, the processRTS() method is used to open the file, read
    and process each line and write the results into a numpy array.  The array DTYPE is:

dtype=[('date', 'S20'), ('time', '<f8'), ('statement', 'S20'), ('mnemonic', 'S20'), ('substitution_parameter', 'S20'), ('substitution_parameter_value', 'S20'), ('DELTA', '<f8'), ('SCS_NUM', 'S5')])
    
    Every command is converted into an array entry.  The column names used in the DTYPE 
    were obtained from OP-19.

    The user can stop there or proceed to the third step which is to convert each 
    ACIS entry in the array into a dict in the SKA.Parse format using 

    convert_ACIS_RTS_to_ska_parse(). 

    Important Note: This class is written with a hook  called:

                            convert_RTS_to_ska_parse(self, RTS_cmds)

                    to translate all of the command lines into dicts, but it's only a stub.
                    convert_ACIS_RTS_to_ska_parse() translates only the ACIS commands
                    in the RTS to SKA.Parse dicts and that's fully functional. 
                    If you wish to translate them all, then use this class as a Base class
                    and overload the convert_RTS_to_ska_parse() method.


    inputs:  1) RTS file location
                  - Directory in which your RTS files canbe found.
                   At present there are only three:
                   
                   1_4_CTI.RTS
                   1_5_CTI.RTS
                   1_CTI06.RTS
                   
              3) Start Time for the execution of the RTS in Chandra DOY format

    outputs:  1) numpy array where each line is a processed line of the RTS file
              2) List of dicts for each ACIS command where the dicts are in SKA.Parse
                 format.

        The important point about using the DELTA's is that if one exists, you MUST apply
        The delta time to the ongoing time stamp before you save the time for that line. 
        
        For example, suppose the time stamp is 2018:001:00:00:00.00 and you are

    def convert_ACIS_RTS_to_ska_parse(self, RTS_cmds):
        """
        This method will convert the input array which is a sequence of 
         processed RTS commands (as output by processRTS) into a list of commands
         in the Ska.Parse/bs_cmds format (i.e. a list of dicts). 
  
         The timing of the commands was already taken care of by processRTS.

        INPUT: 1) Array of RTS file format commands as returned by processRTS

                  Input commands look like this:

array([ ('2018:001:00:00:00.00', 631152069.184, '/CMD', 'OORMPEN', 'None', 'None', 0.0, '135'),
       ('2018:001:00:00:01.00', 631152070.184, 'ACIS', 'WSVIDALLDN', 'None', 'None', 1.0, '135'),
       ('2018:001:00:00:02.00', 631152071.184, '/CMD', '2S2STHV', '2S2STHV2', '0', 1.0, '135'),
....................
     dtype=[('date', 'S20'), ('time', '<f8'), ('statement', 'S20'), ('mnemonic', 'S20'), ('substitution_parameter', 'S20'), ('substitution_parameter_value', 'S20'), ('DELTA', '<f8'), ('SCS_NUM', 'S5')])

               
        OUTPUT: List of dicts where each entry is an ACIS command converted to 
                Backstop File format

        IMPORTANT NOTE:  Any non-ACIS command ( i.e. statement = '/CMD') is ignored.
                         so if you need to convert all the commands in the RTS,
                         then use this class as a base class and overload the
